    <p>I'm Brandon Silverman and these are some things about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I co-founded <a href="https://brandonsilverman.com/crowdtangle/">CrowdTangle</a>, a social analytics tool used by newsrooms, researchers, and elected officials worldwide. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/business/media/crowdtangle-facebook-brandon-silverman.html">New York Times</a> called it "perhaps the greatest transparency tool in the history of social media." Facebook acquired it in 2016. I stayed on as CEO through 2020.</li>
      <li>I care a lot about trying to make the internet, and social media in particular, easier and safer to study. I've testified before the <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/platform-transparency-understanding-the-impact-of-social-media">US Senate</a> and the <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=committees/commrep/25634/&sid=0006">Australian Parliament</a> on questions of platform transparency.</li>
      <li>I'm an affiliate at the Harvard <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center</a> for Internet and Society and a member of the <a href="https://citd.tech/">California Institute for Technology and Democracy</a>'s Tech Advisory Council. Previously, I was a Knight Fellow at George Washington University's <a href="https://iddp.gwu.edu/">Institute for Data, Democracy & Politics</a> and a founding fellow at the <a href="https://integrityinstitute.org/">Integrity Institute</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I write and speak about this stuff:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I write about the internet and regulation on my Substack, <a href="https://brandonsilverman.substack.com/">Some Good Trouble</a>.</li>
      <li>I speak and write about transparency and platform accountability. Some highlights: co-authoring <a href="https://iddp.gwu.edu/case-transparency">The Case For Transparency</a> with GWU, speaking at <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/future-social-media-transparency">Harvard's Berkman Klein Center</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTuf5DirDSY&list=PLWuYED1WVJIN2lb0GGhj65GNHGtxeEvA-&index=11">UNESCO's Global Conference</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQyB9An0Wfg">Stanford's Trust & Safety Conference</a>, appearing on <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/what-s-so-dangerous-about-tiktok-nbc-s-jacob-ward-talks-to-the-experts-167142981838">NBC Nightly News</a> and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNRwTz6lH04">a Mozilla documentary</a>, and interviews with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/business/media/crowdtangle-facebook-brandon-silverman.html">New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-kills-crucial-transparency-tool-worst-possible-time/">Wired</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/the-invasion-of-ukraine-is-not-the-first-social-media-war-but-it-is-the-most-viral/21808456">The Economist</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/5/23058139/meta-tiktok-youtube-senate-transparency-hearing-research-us-europe">The Verge</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91067850/crowdtangles-former-ceo-has-questions-about-metas-decision-to-close-the-research-tool-in-an-election-year">Fast Company</a>, and <a href="https://www.platformer.news/meta-crowdtangle-shutdown-dsa-platform-transparency/">Platformer</a>.</li>
